Assuming motion in two dimensions (horizontal \\(x\\) and vertical \\(y\\) ), we express the acceleration components as: \\(a_x=0,\\quad a_y=-g\\) where \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity. Using kinematic equations: \\(v=v_0+at\\) \\(s=s_0+v_0t+\\frac{1}{2}at^2\\) For horizontal motion: \\(v_x=v_0\\cos\\theta\\) \\(x=v_0\\cos\\theta\\cdot t\\) For vertical motion: \\(v_y=v_0\\sin\\theta-gt\\) \\(y=v_0\\sin\\theta\\cdot t-\\frac{1}{2}gt^2\\) where: - \\(v_0\\) is the initial velocity, - \\(\\theta\\) is the launch angle, - \\(t\\) is time. Solving the Basic Differential Equations The motion of the projectile can also be described using differential equations: \\[\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=0,\\quad\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}=-g\\] Integrating both equations: \\[\\frac{dx}{dt}=v_0\\cos\\theta\\] \\[\\frac{dy}{dt}=v_0\\sin\\theta-gt\\] A second integration gives the position equations: \\[x(t)=v_0\\cos\\theta\\cdot t\\] \\[y(t)=v_0\\sin\\theta\\cdot t-\\frac{1}{2}gt^2\\] Effect of Initial Conditions on Trajectory Time of Flight Setting \\(y=0\\) to find the total flight time: \\[v_0\\sin\\theta\\cdot t-\\frac{1}{2}gt^2=0\\] Solving for \\(t\\) : \\[t=\\frac{2v_0\\sin\\theta}{g}\\] Maximum Height At the peak of the motion, \\(v_y=0\\) : \\[0=v_0\\sin\\theta-gt_{max}\\] Solving for \\(t_{max}\\) : \\[t_{max}=\\frac{v_0\\sin\\theta}{g}\\] Substituting into the vertical position equation: \\[H=\\frac{(v_0\\sin\\theta)^2}{2g}\\] Range of the Projectile The range \\(R\\) is given by: \\[R=v_0\\cos\\theta\\cdot t_{total}\\] Substituting \\(t_{total}=\\frac{2v_0\\sin\\theta}{g}\\) : \\[R=\\frac{v_0^2\\sin2\\theta}{g}\\] Observations The range is maximized at \\(\\theta=45^\\circ\\) . Doubling the initial velocity quadruples the range. Increasing \\(g\\) decreases the range. These equations provide a foundation for further analysis, including air resistance and varying gravitational fields. Analysis of the Range Dependence of Range on Angle of Projection The range \\(R\\) of a projectile launched with an initial velocity \\(v_0\\) at an angle $ heta$ from the horizontal is given by the equation: \\[R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g}\\] where: - \\(v_0\\) is the initial velocity, - $ heta$ is the angle of projection, - \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity. Analysis: The range \\(R\\) is maximized when \\(\\sin 2 heta = 1\\) , which occurs at \\(2 heta = 90^\\circ\\) , or $ heta = 45^\\circ$. For angles $ heta > 45^\\circ$ or $ heta < 45^\\circ$, the range decreases. The function \\(\\sin 2 heta\\) is symmetric about \\(45^\\circ\\) , meaning that angles $ heta$ and \\(90^\\circ - heta\\) produce the same range. Effect of Initial Velocity and Gravitational Acceleration on Range Since the range equation is: \\[R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g},\\] we can analyze the influence of \\(v_0\\) and \\(g\\) : Effect of Initial Velocity \\(v_0\\) : \\[\\frac{dR}{dv_0} = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} > 0\\] The range \\(R\\) increases quadratically with \\(v_0\\) , meaning that doubling the initial velocity results in a fourfold increase in range. Effect of Gravitational Acceleration \\(g\\) : \\[\\frac{dR}{dg} = -\\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g^2} < 0\\] The range \\(R\\) is inversely proportional to \\(g\\) , meaning that increasing gravity decreases the range. On celestial bodies with lower \\(g\\) (e.g., the Moon), the projectile travels much farther. Conclusion The range depends on both the angle and the initial velocity. The maximum range occurs at \\(45^\\circ\\) . Increasing the initial velocity significantly increases the range. A higher gravitational acceleration reduces the range. These principles are crucial in physics, engineering, and ballistics, influencing projectile motion analysis in various fields. Practical Applications of Differential Equations 1. Suspension Bridges Suspension bridges are modeled using second-order differential equations that describe the motion and forces acting on the structure. A common equation used in modeling is: \\[EI\\frac{d^4y}{dx^4}=q(x)\\] where: - \\(E\\) is the Young\u2019s modulus, - \\(I\\) is the second moment of area, - \\(y(x)\\) is the deflection of the bridge deck, - \\(q(x)\\) represents the distributed load. The natural frequency of oscillation is given by: \\[\\omega_n=\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\\] where \\(k\\) is the stiffness of the cables and \\(m\\) is the mass per unit length. 2. Energy Harvesting Systems Energy harvesting systems use vibrational energy to generate power, often modeled as a damped harmonic oscillator: \\[m\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+c\\frac{dx}{dt}+kx=F(t)\\] where: - \\(m\\) is the mass of the system, - \\(c\\) is the damping coefficient, - \\(k\\) is the stiffness, - \\(F(t)\\) represents the external driving force. A piezoelectric harvester converts mechanical energy into electrical energy, where the governing equation includes an electromechanical coupling term: \\[M\\ddot{X}+C\\dot{X}+KX=\\alpha V\\] \\[C_e\\dot{V}+GV=\\alpha\\dot{X}\\] where \\(V\\) is the voltage generated and \\(\\alpha\\) is the coupling coefficient. 3. Driven RLC Circuits An RLC circuit, consisting of a resistor \\(R\\) , inductor \\(L\\) , and capacitor \\(C\\) , is governed by: \\[L\\frac{d^2q}{dt^2}+R\\frac{dq}{dt}+\\frac{q}{C}=V(t)\\] where \\(q\\) is the charge and \\(V(t)\\) is an external driving voltage. For an AC-driven circuit: \\[V(t)=V_0\\cos(\\omega t)\\] The steady-state solution is given by: \\[I(t)=I_0\\cos(\\omega t-\\phi)\\] where the phase shift \\(\\phi\\) is determined by: \\[\\tan\\phi=\\frac{\\omega L-\\frac{1}{\\omega C}}{R}\\] These applications illustrate the fundamental role of differential equations in engineering and physics, governing complex systems from mechanical oscillations to electrical circuits. 4 phyton /plot import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Constants g = 9.8 # Acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2) # Function to calculate the trajectory def calculate_trajectory(v0, theta_deg): theta_rad = np.radians(theta_deg) # Convert angle to radians t_max = 2 * v0 * np.sin(theta_rad) / g # Total time of flight t = np.linspace(0, t_max, 500) # Time array # Calculate x and y coordinates x = v0 * np.cos(theta_rad) * t y = v0 * np.sin(theta_rad) * t - 0.5 * g * t**2 # Filter out points where y < 0 valid_indices = y >= 0 x = x[valid_indices] y = y[valid_indices] return x, y # Part (a): Different Initial Velocities at 45\u00b0 plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) plt.subplot(2, 1, 1) initial_velocities = [30, 40, 50] colors = ['red', 'purple', 'green'] labels = ['30 m/s', '40 m/s', '50 m/s'] for v0, color, label in zip(initial_velocities, colors, labels): x, y = calculate_trajectory(v0, 45) plt.plot(x, y, label=label, color=color) plt.xlabel('Horizontal Distance (x) [m]') plt.ylabel('Vertical Height (y) [m]') plt.title('(a) Different Initial Velocities at 45\u00b0') plt.legend() plt.grid(True) # Part (b): Different Launch Angles at 50 m/s plt.subplot(2, 1, 2) launch_angles = [15, 45, 75, 50] colors = ['red', 'purple', 'green', 'blue'] labels = ['15\u00b0', '45\u00b0', '75\u00b0', '50\u00b0'] for theta, color, label in zip(launch_angles, colors, labels): x, y = calculate_trajectory(50, theta) plt.plot(x, y, label=label, color=color) plt.xlabel('Horizontal Distance (x) [m]') plt.ylabel('Vertical Height (y) [m]') plt.title('(b) Different Launch Angles at 50 m/s') plt.legend() plt.grid(True) plt.tight_layout() plt.show() Colab Colab","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#theoretical-foundation","text":"","title":"Theoretical Foundation"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#derivation-of-governing-equations-of-motion","text":"Projectile motion is governed by Newton's Second Law: \\(F=ma\\) In the absence of air resistance, the only force acting on a projectile is gravity.

Theoretical Foundation 1.1 Governing Equation: Forced Damped Pendulum Consider a pendulum of length \\(L\\) and mass \\(m\\) subject to damping and an external periodic driving force. Let \\(\\theta(t)\\) be the angular displacement from the vertical. The torque \\(\\tau\\) acting on the pendulum includes: Restoring torque : \\(-mgL \\sin(\\theta)\\) Damping torque : \\(-b \\dot{\\theta}\\) , where \\(b\\) is the damping coefficient Driving torque : \\(F_0 \\cos(\\omega t)\\) , where \\(F_0\\) is the forcing amplitude and \\(\\omega\\) is the driving frequency Using Newton\u2019s second law for rotational motion: \\[ I \\ddot{\\theta} = -mgL \\sin(\\theta) - b \\dot{\\theta} + F_0 \\cos(\\omega t) \\] For a simple pendulum, the moment of inertia about the pivot is \\(I = mL^2\\) , hence: \\[ mL^2 \\ddot{\\theta} + b \\dot{\\theta} + mgL \\sin(\\theta) = F_0 \\cos(\\omega t) \\] Dividing through by \\(mL^2\\) : \\[ \\ddot{\\theta} + \\frac{b}{mL^2} \\dot{\\theta} + \\frac{g}{L} \\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{F_0}{mL^2} \\cos(\\omega t) \\] Define: - \\(\\gamma = \\frac{b}{mL^2}\\) (damping ratio) - \\(\\omega_0^2 = \\frac{g}{L}\\) (natural frequency squared) \\(f = \\frac{F_0}{mL^2}\\) (normalized driving amplitude) Then the equation becomes: \\[ \\ddot{\\theta} + \\gamma \\dot{\\theta} + \\omega_0^2 \\sin(\\theta) = f \\cos(\\omega t) \\] This is the nonlinear second-order differential equation governing a forced damped pendulum . 1.2 Small-Angle Approximation and Linearization For small angular displacements , we use the approximation: \\[ \\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta \\] Then the equation reduces to a linear differential equation : \\[ \\ddot{\\theta} + \\gamma \\dot{\\theta} + \\omega_0^2 \\theta = f \\cos(\\omega t) \\] This is a linear nonhomogeneous second-order ODE with constant coefficients.

At resonance, energy input from the driving force maximally compensates for the energy loss, leading to large steady-state oscillations. 2. Analysis of Dynamics 2.1 Effect of the Damping Coefficient \\(\\gamma\\) The damping coefficient \\(\\gamma = \\frac{b}{mL^2}\\) governs the rate of energy loss in the pendulum system. Starting from the linearized equation: \\[ \\ddot{\\theta} + \\gamma \\dot{\\theta} + \\omega_0^2 \\theta = f \\cos(\\omega t) \\] Cases: No damping \\((\\gamma = 0)\\) : Pure resonance at \\(\\omega = \\omega_0\\) Energy grows unbounded in the linear model Underdamping \\((0 < \\gamma < 2\\omega_0)\\) : Oscillatory motion with exponential decay Resonance still occurs, but with finite amplitude Critical damping \\((\\gamma = 2\\omega_0)\\) : Fastest return to equilibrium without oscillations Overdamping \\((\\gamma > 2\\omega_0)\\) : Slow, monotonic return to equilibrium Damping controls the sharpness of the resonance peak and the rate of energy dissipation . 2.2 Effect of Driving Amplitude \\(f\\) Increasing the driving amplitude \\(f\\) affects the steady-state amplitude of oscillations: \\[ A = \\frac{f}{\\sqrt{(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + \\gamma^2 \\omega^2}} \\] For fixed \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) , the amplitude grows linearly with \\(f\\) Larger \\(f\\) can lead to nonlinear behavior , particularly when \\(\\theta\\) is no longer small Physical Implication: A stronger external forcing can excite higher-order modes , break linear assumptions, and push the pendulum into complex or chaotic regimes . 2.3 Effect of Driving Frequency \\(\\omega\\) Driving frequency \\(\\omega\\) plays a crucial role in determining system behavior: At low frequencies \\((\\omega \\ll \\omega_0)\\) : system follows the driving force closely At resonance \\((\\omega \\approx \\omega_r)\\) : maximum energy transfer and oscillation amplitude At high frequencies \\((\\omega \\gg \\omega_0)\\) : system cannot respond effectively; small oscillations Amplitude as a function of \\(\\omega\\) : \\[ A(\\omega) = \\frac{f}{\\sqrt{(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + \\gamma^2 \\omega^2}} \\] Resonance peak shifts lower as \\(\\gamma\\) increases. 2.4 Conditions for Regular Motion Regular (periodic) motion occurs under the following conditions: Low driving amplitude \\(f\\) Moderate damping \\(\\gamma\\) Driving frequency \\(\\omega\\) not near chaotic windows Under these conditions, the system settles into: Steady-state periodic oscillations with the same frequency as the drive Phase-locked behavior where \\(\\theta(t)\\) repeats with period \\(T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}\\) Physical Significance: Regular motion implies predictability and energy balance \u2014the driving force supplies just enough energy to offset damping losses without overwhelming the system. 2.5 Transition to Chaos For larger \\(f\\) and small \\(\\gamma\\) , the system becomes nonlinear and potentially chaotic : Original nonlinear equation: \\[ \\ddot{\\theta} + \\gamma \\dot{\\theta} + \\omega_0^2 \\sin(\\theta) = f \\cos(\\omega t) \\] Characteristics of chaotic motion: Aperiodicity : No repeating patterns in \\(\\theta(t)\\) Sensitivity to initial conditions : Tiny differences in \\(\\theta_0\\) lead to vastly different trajectories Strange attractors in phase space Bifurcation and Route to Chaos: As \\(f\\) increases: - Period doubling bifurcations occur: \\(T \\to 2T \\to 4T \\to \\dots\\) - Eventually leads to chaos Chaos diagram (not shown here) reveals windows of order amidst disorder (e.g., Feigenbaum route ). Physical Implications: Chaos implies the system: - Is deterministic but unpredictable - Shows complexity from simple rules - Models real-world phenomena like climate systems, electrical circuits, and biological rhythms 3.

Optimal power output occurs near resonance conditions. 2. Suspension Bridges and Skyscrapers Bridges like the Tacoma Narrows exhibit aeroelastic oscillations . Subject to damping (wind resistance, structural friction) and forcing (wind gusts, traffic). Analysis helps in designing tuned mass dampers to prevent catastrophic resonance. 3.

Biomechanics and Robotics Legged locomotion : Walking and running involve pendulum-like leg swings. Damping models joint resistance; external driving models muscular input or terrain forces.
