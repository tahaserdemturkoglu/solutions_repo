# Problem 1

# Problem Setup: Coherent Wave Sources on a Regular Polygon

## 1. Geometric Configuration

We begin by selecting a regular polygon with $N$ vertices. Each vertex is assigned a coherent point wave source. Common choices include:

- Equilateral triangle ($N = 3$)
- Square ($N = 4$)
- Regular pentagon ($N = 5$)

Assume the polygon is inscribed in a circle of radius $R$, centered at the origin $(0, 0)$. The position $\vec{r}_n$ of the $n$-th source is given in Cartesian coordinates by:

$$
\vec{r}_n = R \begin{bmatrix}
\cos\left( \theta_n \right) \\
\sin\left( \theta_n \right)
\end{bmatrix}, \quad \theta_n = \frac{2\pi n}{N}, \quad n = 0, 1, \dots, N-1
$$

Each point source emits a spherical (or circular, in 2D) wave centered at $\vec{r}_n$.

## 2. Wave Parameters

All sources emit waves that are **coherent**, meaning they share identical physical properties:

- **Amplitude**: $A$
- **Wavelength**: $\lambda$
- **Frequency**: $f$
- **Initial Phase**: $\phi_0$ (same for all)

The wavenumber $k$ and angular frequency $\omega$ are defined by:

$$
k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}, \quad \omega = 2\pi f
$$

Each source emits a wave of the form:

$$
\psi_n(\vec{r}, t) = A \cdot \frac{1}{|\vec{r} - \vec{r}_n|} \cdot \cos\left( k |\vec{r} - \vec{r}_n| - \omega t + \phi_0 \right)
$$

In 2D, the $1/|\vec{r} - \vec{r}_n|$ decay can be replaced by a logarithmic or Bessel-type function depending on boundary conditions and dimensionality, but for simplicity, we retain the inverse-distance decay.

---

## 3. Superposition Principle

The total wave field at a point $\vec{r}$ is the superposition of the fields from all $N$ sources:

$$
\Psi(\vec{r}, t) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \psi_n(\vec{r}, t)
$$

Since all sources are coherent, interference patterns will emerge due to the phase differences arising from different path lengths.

---

## 4. Simplified Case: Far-Field Approximation

In the far-field regime ($|\vec{r}| \gg R$), the distance approximation becomes:

$$
|\vec{r} - \vec{r}_n| \approx r - \hat{r} \cdot \vec{r}_n
$$

where $\hat{r} = \vec{r} / |\vec{r}|$ is the unit vector in the observation direction. The wave from each source becomes:

$$
\psi_n(\vec{r}, t) \approx \frac{A}{r} \cos\left( k r - k \hat{r} \cdot \vec{r}_n - \omega t + \phi_0 \right)
$$

And the total field becomes:

$$
\Psi(\vec{r}, t) \approx \frac{A}{r} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \cos\left( k r - k \hat{r} \cdot \vec{r}_n - \omega t + \phi_0 \right)
$$

This form is useful for analyzing angular interference patterns and diffraction lobes.

# Mathematical Formulation

We now formally describe the wave behavior generated by multiple coherent point sources located at the vertices of a regular polygon.

---

## 1. Single Point Source Wave Equation

The surface displacement $\eta(\vec{r}, t)$ at a point $\vec{r} = (x, y)$ on the water surface due to a single point source is described by:

$$
\eta(\vec{r}, t) = A \cos(k r - \omega t + \phi)
$$

where:

- $A$ is the wave amplitude
- $k$ is the wavenumber: $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$
- $\omega$ is the angular frequency: $\omega = 2\pi f$
- $\phi$ is the initial phase
- $r = |\vec{r} - \vec{r}_i|$ is the distance between the observation point and the source

---

## 2. Wave Equation for Multiple Sources

Let there be $N$ sources located at positions $\vec{r}_i = (x_i, y_i)$ for $i = 0, 1, ..., N-1$. The distance from the $i$-th source to a point $(x, y)$ on the water surface is:

$$
r_i = \sqrt{(x - x_i)^2 + (y - y_i)^2}
$$

The surface displacement due to the $i$-th source is then:

$$
\eta_i(x, y, t) = A \cos(k r_i - \omega t + \phi)
$$

Since all sources are coherent and have the same amplitude $A$, wavelength $\lambda$, frequency $f$, and initial phase $\phi$, the only variable is the distance $r_i$.

---

## 3. Total Surface Displacement by Superposition

Using the linear superposition principle, the total displacement at point $(x, y)$ and time $t$ due to all $N$ sources is:

$$
\eta_{\text{total}}(x, y, t) = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \eta_i(x, y, t)
$$

Substituting the individual waveforms:

$$
\eta_{\text{total}}(x, y, t) = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} A \cos\left(k \sqrt{(x - x_i)^2 + (y - y_i)^2} - \omega t + \phi \right)
$$

This expression gives the instantaneous surface profile of the water at any point $(x, y)$ and time $t$ due to multiple coherent sources.

## 4. Key Definitions Recap

| Symbol | Description                         |
|--------|-------------------------------------|
| $A$    | Amplitude of each wave              |
| $\lambda$ | Wavelength                    |
| $f$    | Frequency                           |
| $k$    | Wavenumber, $k = \dfrac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ |
| $\omega$ | Angular frequency, $\omega = 2\pi f$ |
| $\phi$ | Initial phase (identical for all)   |
| $(x_i, y_i)$ | Coordinates of source $i$    |
| $(x, y)$ | Observation point on the surface |
| $r_i$  | Distance from source $i$ to $(x, y)$ |

---

> **Note:** This formulation assumes the medium is homogeneous, isotropic, and supports linear wave propagation. Nonlinear or dissipative effects are neglected in this model.

# 3. Interference Analysis

Interference arises when multiple coherent wave sources overlap spatially and temporally. The resulting surface displacement $\eta_{\text{total}}(x, y, t)$ is the sum of individual contributions from each source, leading to patterns of constructive and destructive interference.

---

## 3.1 Constructive Interference

**Constructive interference** occurs at points where the phase difference between waves from different sources is an integer multiple of $2\pi$:

$$
k(r_i - r_j) = 2\pi m, \quad m \in \mathbb{Z}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
r_i - r_j = m \lambda
$$

At such points, the cosine terms align in phase, reinforcing each other. The amplitude of the total wave displacement is maximized.

### Conditions:
- Equal distances from the observation point to multiple sources (or integer-multiple differences)
- $\eta_{\text{total}}(x, y, t)$ reaches local maxima

---

## 3.2 Destructive Interference

**Destructive interference** occurs when the phase difference between sources equals an odd multiple of $\pi$:

$$
k(r_i - r_j) = (2m + 1)\pi, \quad m \in \mathbb{Z}
$$

This implies:

$$
r_i - r_j = \left(m + \frac{1}{2}\right)\lambda
$$

Waves at these points arrive out of phase and cancel, resulting in minimal or zero net displacement.

### Conditions:
- Half-wavelength path differences
- Phase opposition leads to amplitude nullification

---

## 3.3 Spatial and Temporal Dependence

The total wave field depends on both **position** $(x, y)$ and **time** $t$:

$$
\eta_{\text{total}}(x, y, t) = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} A \cos\left(k r_i(x, y) - \omega t + \phi\right)
$$

At any fixed $t$, the **spatial pattern** of interference can be analyzed as a standing wave pattern formed by overlapping traveling waves.

Over time, these patterns **oscillate sinusoidally**, but their constructive/destructive regions remain **fixed in space** unless the wave properties or source positions change.

---

## 3.4 Effect of Polygon Geometry

The **geometry of the regular polygon** significantly influences the interference pattern:

- **Symmetry**: Regular polygons induce **radial and rotational symmetry** in the interference field.
- **Number of Sides ($N$)**: More sources increase complexity and introduce **higher angular harmonics** in the interference pattern.
- **Vertex Spacing**: As vertices become more densely packed (e.g., larger $N$), interference fringes become finer and more numerous.

For instance:

- A **triangle** ($N = 3$) creates broad, triangularly symmetric lobes.
- A **square** ($N = 4$) induces fourfold symmetry and checkerboard-like regions of interference.
- A **pentagon** ($N = 5$) yields complex, star-like interference fields due to irrational angle multiples.

These effects stem from the phase differences governed by:

$$
r_i(x, y) = \sqrt{(x - x_i)^2 + (y - y_i)^2}
$$

which depend on the geometric layout of source positions $\{(x_i, y_i)\}$.

---

> **Conclusion:** Interference is governed by the superposition of coherent waves with fixed phase relationships. Geometry plays a central role, and the resulting spatial interference pattern reflects both the physical arrangement and the wave parameters.
